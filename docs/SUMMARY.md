# Code Controller (CC) Project Summary

## Overview
Code Controller (CC) is an interface built on top of Claude Code CLI that automates code generation and manages multiple implementation versions through Git branching. It provides a way to generate different implementations of the same project using different frameworks, manage features, and compare implementations.

## Current Functionality
The CLI now supports the following commands:
- `cc init [project-name]` - Initialize a new project with a Git repository
- `cc generate [description]` - Generate implementations using different frameworks
- `cc select [implementation]` - Select an implementation as the active one
- `cc feature [description]` - Add a feature to the selected implementation
- `cc list [resource]` - List projects, implementations, or features
- `cc status` - Show detailed status information about the current project
- `cc compare [branch1] [branch2]` - Compare two implementations or features

## Project Structure

## Implementation Notes

### CLI Commands
The CLI commands are implemented using Cobra, a powerful command-line library for Go. Each command follows a consistent pattern:
1. Load the configuration
2. Get the active project
3. Create necessary providers (AI, VCS)
4. Perform the requested operation
5. Update the project model
6. Save the configuration

All commands are tested with unit tests using mock providers.

### Docker Provider
The Docker provider is now fully implemented using shell commands rather than Docker SDK for better compatibility. It supports:
- Container creation and management
- File copying between host and container
- Command execution in containers
- Container lifecycle management (stop, remove)
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Automatic image pulling when needed
- Sudo support for environments with restricted permissions
- Permission fixing for files copied from container

The Docker provider is designed to run Claude Code in a container, with volume mounts for project files and environment variables for configuration. Using shell commands instead of the Docker SDK makes the provider more robust across different environments and Docker versions.

### Git Integration
The Git operations are now fully implemented in the CLI commands using the go-git library. This includes:
- Creating implementation branches when generating code
- Switching between implementation branches when selecting an implementation
- Creating feature branches based on implementations
- Committing changes to the appropriate branches
- Displaying real Git branch information in status output
- Comparing different branches with actual Git diff

### AI Provider
The Claude AI provider is implemented to interact with the Claude Code CLI through a Docker container. Currently, it's stubbed out for testing, but the interface is designed to support actual code generation with Claude.


### Claude AI Provider
The Claude AI provider is fully implemented to interact with the Claude Code CLI through a Docker container. It supports:
- Generating projects from descriptions
- Creating implementations with specific frameworks
- Adding features to existing code
- Analyzing code for quality and improvements
- Smart image selection between mock and real Claude Code images
- Workspace management for file transfers
- Proper container lifecycle management
- Detailed output summarization for better user feedback
- Error handling with fallback implementation generation

### Git VCS Provider
The Git VCS provider is implemented using go-git library. It supports:
- Initializing repositories
- Creating and switching branches 
- Committing changes
- Storing metadata for branches
- Exporting diffs between branches

## Next Steps
1. Add comprehensive logging throughout the application
2. Enhance error handling and recovery strategies
3. Implement the plugin system for custom frameworks
4. Add support for authentication with private Docker registries 
5. Create more comprehensive tests for all components
6. Add support for project templates and framework-specific configurations
7. Implement metrics and scoring for implementations
8. Add advanced Git operations like merging features back to implementations
9. Improve user documentation with examples and tutorials
10. Create a configuration UI for easier setup
