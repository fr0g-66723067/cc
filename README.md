# Code Controller (CC)

## Overview
Code Controller (CC) is an advanced interface built on top of Claude Code CLI that automates and streamlines AI-powered code generation. It enables rapid prototyping and exploration of different implementation approaches through automated git branching.

## Key Features

### Multi-version Prototyping
- Generate multiple versions of the same application using different frameworks and approaches
- Each version is maintained in its own git branch for easy comparison and switching
- Example: "Create a web app to track daily tasks" will generate versions using React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

### Project Evolution
- Select your preferred version as the base implementation
- Incrementally enhance your chosen implementation by requesting new features
- Each feature request creates a new branch, allowing for easy feature comparison and rollback

### Workflow
1. Define your project requirements
2. CC generates multiple implementation versions using Claude
3. Review and select your preferred implementation approach
4. Incrementally add features through natural language requests
5. Navigate between different versions and feature branches easily

### Benefits
- Dramatically accelerates initial prototyping and exploration
- Enables testing different frameworks and architectural approaches without manual setup
- Provides a structured way to compare different implementation strategies
- Maintains a clean version history through automated git branching

## Technical Details
- Built as a command-line tool with a straightforward interface
- Automates interactions with Claude Code CLI
- Handles git operations transparently
- Supports a wide range of project types and frameworks
