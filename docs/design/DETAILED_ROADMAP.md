# Code Controller (CC) - Detailed Development Roadmap

## Project Purpose
Code Controller (CC) is a CLI interface built on top of Claude Code that automates code generation and manages multiple implementation approaches through Git branching. It enables developers to:
1. Generate multiple implementations of the same project using different frameworks
2. Compare different implementation approaches
3. Incrementally add features to selected implementations
4. Manage all versions using Git branching

## Current Status

### Completed
- âœ… Core architecture and design patterns established
- âœ… Interface-based provider system (AI, Container, VCS)
- âœ… Configuration management system
- âœ… Project and implementation data models
- âœ… Command-line interface structure using Cobra
- âœ… Basic CLI commands (init, generate, select, feature, list, compare, status)
- âœ… Mock providers for testing
- âœ… Basic test implementation of the Docker provider
- âœ… Unit tests for core functionality

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Integration tests for core workflows
- ðŸ”„ Testing Docker provider with actual Docker daemon

### Recently Completed
- âœ… Claude AI provider implementation with Docker integration - fully implemented
- âœ… Docker provider implementation using Docker SDK - fully implemented
- âœ… Actual Git operations in CLI commands - fully implemented

## Short-term Goals (Next Phase)

### 1. Enhance Logging and Error Handling
- Add detailed logging throughout the application
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Add progress reporting for long-running operations
- Improve user feedback

#### Tasks:
- Add structured logging
- Implement retries for Docker operations
- Add better error messages for container operations
- Create progress indicators for long-running tasks

### 2. Enhance Git Operations
- Handle merge conflicts between branches
- Add feature branch merging back to implementations
- Implement advanced Git operations
- Optimize Git error handling and recovery

#### Tasks:
- Implement branch merging functionality
- Add support for rebasing feature branches
- Create UI for resolving merge conflicts
- Improve Git error messages and recovery strategies
- Add detailed logging for Git operations

### 3. Integrate with Claude Code CLI
- Implement actual Claude Code CLI invocation
- Pass prompts to Claude correctly
- Handle Claude Code output parsing
- Implement proper error handling for Claude operations

#### Tasks:
- Update AI provider to invoke actual Claude Code CLI
- Implement prompt generation for different frameworks
- Handle Claude Code output parsing
- Add configuration for Claude Code parameters

## Medium-term Goals

### 1. Enhanced Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- End-to-end tests for CLI commands
- Performance testing

#### Tasks:
- Add unit tests for all CLI commands
- Create integration tests for common workflows
- Implement end-to-end tests with a real project
- Add test coverage reporting

### 2. Plugin System
- Implement plugin architecture for extensibility
- Support custom framework templates
- Allow custom code generation strategies
- Support third-party tools integration

#### Tasks:
- Design plugin interface
- Implement plugin loading and management
- Create documentation for plugin development
- Develop example plugins

### 3. Metrics and Scoring
- Implement quality metrics for generated code
- Add scoring system for implementations
- Provide comparison metrics between implementations
- Support custom metrics through plugins

#### Tasks:
- Design metrics calculation system
- Implement basic metrics (complexity, maintainability)
- Add reporting system for metrics
- Create visualization of metrics

## Long-term Goals

### 1. Advanced AI Features
- Support multiple LLM providers (not just Claude)
- Implement advanced prompting techniques
- Add code refactoring capabilities
- Support code explanation and documentation generation

### 2. Collaboration Features
- Support team workflows
- Implement sharing of implementations
- Add commenting and feedback mechanisms
- Support integration with CI/CD pipelines

### 3. User Interface
- Add a web-based UI for project management
- Implement visualization of implementation differences
- Create a dashboard for project metrics
- Support visual comparison of implementations

## Technical Debt and Improvements
