# Code Controller (CC) Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the current implementation of Code Controller (CC) with a focus on the Claude Docker container integration. All mock implementations have been replaced with real functionality.

## Overall Architecture

CC is a CLI tool built in Go that:
1. Manages Git branches for different implementations and features
2. Integrates with Docker to run Claude Code in a container
3. Provides a unified interface for AI-powered code generation

## Claude Docker Container Implementation

### Key Components

1. **Docker Container Setup**
   - Enhanced Dockerfile for Claude Code CLI
   - Environment variable handling with .env file support
   - Secure API key management
   - Proper entrypoint and initialization scripts

2. **Container Management**
   - Creation, running, and cleanup of containers
   - Volume mounting for workspaces
   - Command execution in containers
   - File copying between host and container

3. **Claude CLI Integration**
   - Using the real Claude Code CLI within the container
   - Secure API key passing
   - Multiple authentication fallback mechanisms

4. **Environment Variable Handling**
   - Loading from .env files
   - Support for environment variables
   - Secure storage of API keys

### Implementation Details

1. **Dockerfile Enhancements**
   - Added real Claude CLI installation
   - Created .env loader script
   - Implemented Claude wrapper script
   - Proper entrypoint handling

2. **Provider Implementation**
   - Docker provider for container operations
   - Claude provider for AI operations
   - Secure API key handling and transfer

3. **Testing Support**
   - Added mock providers for testing
   - Unit test coverage for provider functionality
   - Test helper methods

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Setup script for easy initialization
   - Better error handling and feedback
   - Multiple authentication methods

## CLI Commands

The following commands are fully implemented:

- `cc init` - Initialize a new project
- `cc generate` - Generate implementations using Claude AI
- `cc select` - Select an implementation as base
- `cc feature` - Add a feature to selected implementation
- `cc list` - List projects, implementations, or features
- `cc compare` - Compare implementations or features
- `cc status` - Show project status

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.cc/config.json` and includes:
- Container provider settings
- AI provider settings
- VCS provider settings
- Project directory settings
- Active project tracking

## Implemented Features

1. **Core Docker Container Integration**
   - Real Claude Code CLI implementation (no mocks)
   - Secure API key management via .env files
   - Container lifecycle management with proper cleanup
   - Environment variable handling with multiple fallback mechanisms

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Complete mock providers for unit testing
   - Integration test support
   - Error handling and recovery testing

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - Secure API key storage and transmission
   - Multiple authentication methods (env vars, config, CLI flags)
   - Environment isolation for secure execution

## Remaining Steps

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implement more robust error recovery strategies
   - Add request retries for network or API failures
   - Better user feedback for specific error conditions

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement container pooling to reduce startup times
   - Add caching for repeated operations
   - Optimize parallel implementation generation

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Implement terminal UI enhancements
   - Add colorized output for better readability

4. **Additional Features**
   - Support for more AI models beyond Claude
   - Expand the plugin system for custom frameworks
   - Add template-based project generation
   - Implement advanced Git operations (merging, rebasing)
